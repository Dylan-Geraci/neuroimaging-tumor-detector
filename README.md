We aim to develop an ML-powered system that can classify brain MRI scans into four categories—glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, or no tumor—and provide visual explanations of each prediction. The goal is to create a transparent, accessible web application that supports early detection and improves trust in AI-assisted diagnosis.
